# Artificial Intelligence Course
## Project: Demonstration Of AI Algorithms

Project code for Artificial Intelligence Course. In this project, We developed code for demonstrating different common AI algorithms when applied to the N-Puzzle problem. .

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [time](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [.py](https://www.python.org/) file.

I recommend installing [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project.

### Run

The program was deployed onto a website, which can be found [here](https://npuzzle.pythonanywhere.com/)
